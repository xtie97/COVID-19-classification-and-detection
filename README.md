# COVID-19-classification-and-detection
# This repository is for CS771 course project

Multiple tasks were studied, including using CXRs to identify COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 (both positive and negative cases were confirmed RT-PCR tests) and detecting COVID-19 pneumonia based on radiologists' annotations (bounding boxes).  

This repo is under maintenance.
