# COVID-19-classification-and-detection :microbe:

Welcome to the repository for the CS771 course (Learning-based Computer Vision) project, dedicated to comprehensive studies related to COVID-19 detection and classification using radiological methodologies.

## :bookmark_tabs: Tasks Undertaken

1. **COVID-19 Identification**: Utilized CXRs to differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. Both positive and negative cases were corroborated using RT-PCR tests. We also published several papers in this field:
***Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia by Using Chest Radiography: Value of Artificial Intelligence***
[https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020202944]
***A Generalizable Artificial Intelligence Model for COVID-19 Classification Task Using Chest X-ray Radiographs: Evaluated Over Four Clinical Datasets with 15,097 Patients***[https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02189]

3. **Pneumonia Detection**: Focused on pinpointing COVID-19 induced pneumonia based on meticulous annotations from radiologists, represented as bounding boxes.
4. **Report Turnaround Time (RTAT) Simulation**: Simulated RTAT to elucidate potential advantages in streamlining patient triage.
