# COVID-19-classification-and-detection
# This repository is for CS771 course project

Multiple tasks were studied.

(1) Use CXRs to identify COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 (both positive and negative cases were confirmed RT-PCR tests). 

(2) Detecting COVID-19 pneumonia based on radiologists' annotations (bounding boxes). 

(3) Simulate report turnaround time (RTAT) to demonstrate the potential benefits in patient triage.

This repo is under maintenance.
